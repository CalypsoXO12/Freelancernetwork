"Hello Replit AI,

I need you to build a complete, responsive, and user-friendly website called 'Freelance Financial Toolkit' (or suggest a better, catchy name if you have one).

1. Overall Purpose & Niche:
The website will offer a suite of simple online financial calculators specifically designed for freelancers, solopreneurs, and independent contractors. The goal is to provide quick, easy-to-use tools that help them manage their finances and make informed business decisions. The tone should be trustworthy, helpful, and empowering.

2. Website Structure & Pages:
Please create the following pages with a clean, modern, and professional design. Ensure easy navigation (e.g., a top navigation bar and a footer with links). The website should be mobile-responsive.

a. Homepage (index.html):

Headline: e.g., "Simplify Your Freelance Finances" or "Essential Financial Tools for Independent Professionals."
Sub-headline: Briefly explain the site's value (e.g., "Quick, free, and easy calculators to help you thrive as a freelancer.").
Introduction: A short paragraph about the challenges freelancers face with finances and how these tools can help.
Call to Action Sections: Clearly link to each calculator tool available on the site (e.g., "Calculate Your Ideal Hourly Rate," "Estimate Your Project Profitability"). Use icons or simple graphics for each tool.
Brief 'Why Us': A small section on the benefits of using these tools (e.g., "Accurate," "Easy to Use," "Free").
b. About Us (about.html):

Placeholder text for a mission statement (e.g., "Our mission is to empower freelancers with accessible financial tools...").
Placeholder for how the site came to be or the team behind it (even if it's just you).
c. Contact Us (contact.html):

A simple contact form (Fields: Name, Email, Message) that would theoretically send an email (you can make this a placeholder for now, or if possible, set it up with a service like Formspree later).
Alternatively, display a placeholder email address (e.g., support@freelancefinancialtoolkit.com).
d. Privacy Policy (privacy.html):

Generate standard placeholder privacy policy text. Mention that the site uses cookies (especially if planning for AdSense and analytics) and how user data (if any is collected by tools) is handled (for now, assume no user data from tools is stored server-side).
e. Terms of Service (terms.html):

Generate standard placeholder terms of service text. Include a disclaimer that the financial tools are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial advice. Users should consult with a qualified financial professional for personalized advice. This is very important.
f. Calculator Tool Pages (Individual HTML pages for each):

Each calculator should have its own dedicated page for better SEO and user experience.
3. Calculator Tool Specifications:
Please create the following two financial calculators initially. They should be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for client-side calculations. Ensure clear input fields, intuitive design, and real-time result display.

i. Freelancer Hourly Rate Calculator (hourly-rate-calculator.html):

Purpose: Helps freelancers determine a profitable hourly rate.
Input Fields (with clear labels and placeholder examples):
Desired Annual Income ($): (e.g., 60000)
Annual Billable Hours (hours): (e.g., 1500 - provide a note like "Typically 25-30 hours/week x 50 weeks")
Annual Business Expenses ($): (e.g., 5000 - software, utilities, etc.)
Desired Profit Margin (%): (e.g., 20 - for reinvestment, savings, etc.)
Calculation Logic (JavaScript):
Total Costs = Desired Annual Income + Annual Business Expenses
Rate Before Profit = Total Costs / Annual Billable Hours
Profit Amount = Rate Before Profit * (Desired Profit Margin / 100)
Suggested Hourly Rate = Rate Before Profit + Profit Amount
Output Display: Clearly display the Suggested Hourly Rate ($) formatted to two decimal places.
Content: Include a brief explanation of why each input is important. Add a "Reset" button to clear all fields.
ii. Simple Project Profitability Calculator (project-profit-calculator.html):

Purpose: Helps freelancers quickly estimate the profitability of a potential project.
Input Fields (with clear labels and placeholder examples):
Project Revenue / Quoted Price ($): (e.g., 2000)
Total Estimated Project Costs ($): (e.g., 300 - software, specific materials, subcontractor costs, etc. Do not include your own labor time here if using an hourly rate derived from the other calculator for your time).
Calculation Logic (JavaScript):
Net Profit ($) = Project Revenue - Total Estimated Project Costs
Profit Margin (%) = (Net Profit / Project Revenue) * 100 (Handle division by zero if Project Revenue is 0).
Output Display: Clearly display Net Profit ($) and Profit Margin (%), both formatted to two decimal places.
Content: Include a brief explanation of the tool. Add a "Reset" button.
4. Design, Styling, and Technology:

Frontend: Use HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+).
Styling:
Aim for a clean, professional, and minimalist design.
Use a readable font.
Ensure good contrast for accessibility.
Make it mobile-responsive (CSS media queries).
You can use a lightweight CSS framework if it simplifies things (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS, but vanilla CSS is fine if well-structured), or just custom CSS.
No Backend Database for MVP: For now, all calculators should work client-side. No user data needs to be stored server-side for the calculators themselves.
JavaScript: Write clean, well-commented JavaScript for the calculator logic. Ensure inputs are validated (e.g., numbers only).
5. AdSense & Future Premium Features Considerations (Placeholder):

AdSense: The design should allow for unobtrusive placement of Google AdSense ads in the future (e.g., sidebar, header, or below the calculator results). You don't need to add the ad slots, but keep space/layout in mind.
Premium Placeholder (Optional but nice to have):
On each calculator page, perhaps below the tool or in the footer, include a small, unobtrusive text link like: "Unlock Advanced Features & Ad-Free Version with Pro!"
This link can go to a simple placeholder page: premium-features.html.
premium-features.html: A basic page with a headline like "Premium Features Coming Soon!" and a brief list of potential future benefits (e.g., "Save your calculations," "Export to PDF," "More advanced calculators," "Ad-free experience").
6. SEO Basics:

Use appropriate HTML title tags for each page (e.g., "Freelancer Hourly Rate Calculator | Freelance Financial Toolkit").
Use semantic HTML (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <footer>).
Generate placeholder meta descriptions for each page.
Example structure for a calculator page (hourly-rate-calculator.html):
